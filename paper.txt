Pitch :
1)Join end 2 end system:
2)a)Real life failure is expensive to get
 b) crowd sourced end2end system with +1/-1 reward feedback is easy and detailed feedback is hard to get
 3) wtih our new algorithm, we can do this=> MDP + co-active
 4)experiments , 
 -overall it improved(data, metric)
 -show that it fixed the right thing ("experts fixing each piece")
